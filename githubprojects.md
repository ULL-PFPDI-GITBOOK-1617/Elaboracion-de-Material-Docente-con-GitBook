## GitHub Projects: Tracking the progress of your work with projects

Projects on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create projects 
* for specific feature work, 
* comprehensive roadmaps, or even 
* release checklists. 
With projects, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.

Projects are made up of 
1. issues, 
2. pull requests, and 
3. notes 

that are categorized as **cards** in columns of your choosing. 
Cards can be moved from column to column and reordered according to your needs.

**Project cards** contain relevant metadata for issues and pull requests, like 
* labels, 
* assignees, 
* the status, and 
* who opened it. 
To see more details about the issue or pull request, you can easily navigate to it by clicking the link within the card.

* You can create **notes** within columns to serve as task reminders or to add information related to the project. 
* If the note isn't sufficient for your needs, **you can convert it to an issue**. 
* For more information on project notes as well as how to convert them to issues, see 
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-notes-to-a-project" class="km-article-link">Adding notes to a project</a>

There are two types of project boards:

* **Repository projects** are scoped to issues, pull requests, and notes within a **single repository**.
* **Organization-wide projects** can contain issues and pull requests from any repository that belongs to an organization. 
  - If an organization-wide project includes issues or pull requests from a repository that you don't have permission to view, the card will be removed (redacted).

Creating and viewing projects:

* Anyone with read access to a repository or organization can view a project. 
* To create a repository project, **you must have write access to the repository**. 
* **Any organization member can create** an organization-wide project.

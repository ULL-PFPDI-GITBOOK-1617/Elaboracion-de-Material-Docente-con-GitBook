## Que es una rama

Branching, in revision control and software configuration management, is the duplication of an object under revision control  so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches.

The originating branch is sometimes called the upstream branch.

Branching also generally implies the ability to later merge or integrate changes back onto the parent branch. Often the changes are merged back to the trunk, even if this is not the parent branch. A branch not intended to be merged (e.g. because it has been relicensed under an incompatible license by a third party, or it attempts to serve a different purpose) is usually called a fork.
